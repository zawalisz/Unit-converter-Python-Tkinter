# Unit Converter
This is a simple GUI program built with Tkinter that allows you to convert units of measurement between different categories such as length, mass, temperature, and more. The conversion factors for different units are stored in a separate Python module named factors.py.

﻿## Usage
To run the program, simply execute the unit_converter.py file. Once the program starts, select the category of the quantity you want to convert (e.g., length), the unit you want to convert from (e.g., meters), the unit you want to convert to (e.g., centimeters), and enter the value you want to convert. Press the "Convert" button to see the result.
